# Product Context

This document outlines the "why" behind the project, the problems it aims to solve, and the desired user experience.

## Purpose and Problem Solved
WTFDIG (Where The Fuck Do I Go?) is a helper tool for Final Fantasy XIV players. It solves the problem of needing to quickly reference complex raid strategies by providing condensed, role-specific guides. This allows players to efficiently learn and execute mechanics during high-pressure encounters.

## How it Should Work
Users will visit the site and first select a specific Final Fantasy XIV fight. After selecting the fight, they will navigate to a dedicated page for that fight (organized by FF14 patch and fight name). On this page, they can select:
- One or more specific strategies for the fight.
- Their player Role (e.g., Tank, Healer, DPS).
- Their Light Party (a sub-group within the raid).

Once these selections are made, the system will display the chosen strategies. For each strategy, it will provide relevant images and text descriptions tailored specifically to the user's selected role and light party, highlighting their specific positioning and actions.

## User Experience Goals
The primary user experience goals are:
- **Efficiency**: Players should be able to quickly find and understand the information they need.
- **Clarity**: Strategy guides should be clear, concise, and easy to interpret, especially under pressure.
- **Relevance**: Information presented should be highly relevant to the user's selected role and light party, minimizing cognitive load.
- **Accessibility**: The tool should be easy to navigate and use for all players, regardless of their technical proficiency.
- **Reliability**: The strategies and information provided should be accurate and up-to-date.
