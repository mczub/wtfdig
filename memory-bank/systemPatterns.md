# System Patterns

This document describes the system architecture, key technical decisions, design patterns in use, component relationships, and critical implementation paths.

## Architecture Overview
[Provide a high-level overview of the system's architecture. (e.g., client-server, microservices, monolithic, event-driven)]

## Key Technical Decisions
[List and explain significant technical decisions made during development. (e.g., choice of database, specific frameworks, authentication methods)]

## Design Patterns
[Document any recurring design patterns used throughout the codebase. (e.g., MVC, Factory, Singleton, Observer)]

## Component Relationships
[Describe how different components or modules interact with each other. A diagram (e.g., Mermaid) can be very helpful here.]

## Critical Implementation Paths
[Highlight any particularly complex or crucial implementation paths that require careful attention.]
