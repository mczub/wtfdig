This is WTFDIG (where the fuck do i go?). It is a helper tool for Final Fantasy 14 players that enables them to view condensed strategy guides based on selected fights, strategies, and roles.
Upon visiting the site, users can select a FF14 fight. After selecting the fight, the player then navigates to a page (separated by FF14 patch and fight) that allows them to select a number of strategies, along with their Role and Light Party.
After selecting all of this information, the user can then view all of the strategies, along with text descriptions specific to their role.

Currently, the following fights are implemented:
- Patch 7.1: Cloud of Darkness (Chaotic)
- Patch 7.2: EX4, M5S, M6S, M7S, M8S
- Ultimates: Dragonsong's Reprise (DSR)

The main part of the project lives within the /wtfdig folder, not the root directory.
