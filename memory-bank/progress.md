# Progress

This document tracks what works, what's left to build, current status, known issues, and the evolution of project decisions.

## What Works
- **Memory Bank Review**: All core memory bank files have been reviewed and confirmed to be up to date.
- **Memory Bank Synchronization**: All core memory bank files are now synchronized with the current project state.
- **Project Documentation**: `projectbrief.md` now accurately reflects all implemented fights, including the Dragonsong's Reprise (Ultimate).
- **Core Memory Bank Initialization**: All core memory bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) have been created and populated with initial, relevant content.
- **Project Overview**: A foundational understanding of WTFDIG's purpose, architecture, and technical stack has been established.

## What's Left to Build
- **Detailed Strategy Content**: The actual raid strategy content (images and text) needs to be fully integrated and organized within the `static/` and potentially other content directories.
- **Dynamic Content Filtering Logic**: Implementation of the logic within `+page.ts` files to filter and present strategies based on user selections (fight, strategies, role, light party).
- **UI Components**: Further development and refinement of Svelte components (`Cheatsheet.svelte`, `StratView.svelte`, `ImagePreview.svelte`) to effectively display the strategy content.
- **User Input Mechanisms**: Implementation of UI elements for users to select fights, strategies, roles, and light parties.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Development of a testing suite to ensure the accuracy and reliability of strategy data and application functionality.
- **Deployment Pipeline**: Automation of the build and deployment process for static hosting.

## Current Status
The project's memory bank is now fully updated and synchronized with the project's file structure. The foundational documentation is complete, providing a solid base for future development. The core structure for a SvelteKit static site is in place, but the application-specific logic and content are largely unbuilt.

## Known Issues
- The strategy content itself is not yet fully integrated or structured.
- No explicit testing framework has been identified or set up yet.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- The decision to use Bun as the primary package manager has been confirmed and documented.
- The emphasis on static site generation and client-side rendering is a core architectural decision that will guide future development.
