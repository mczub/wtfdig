# WTFDIG - Where The F*ck Do I Go?

WTFDIG is a helper tool for Final Fantasy XIV players that enables them to view condensed strategy guides for various high-end duties. Users can select a fight, specific strategies, their role, and their light party to get customized, easy-to-read guides with visual aids.

This project is built with SvelteKit and Tailwind CSS, and it is designed to be a fast, client-side, statically-generated website.
